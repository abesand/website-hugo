Initially my intentions of hosting my own site was to have my own email server. It took a while and a lot of troubleshooting. But I’m happy to announce that it’s finally here and you can reach me at [email](mailto:contact@abrahamsandoval.xyz). It’s open to everyone and you can expect a reply within a day. More things will be coming to the site as time goes on so stay tuned for that. The picture below is thunderbird. A gui email client to send and recieve emails.
